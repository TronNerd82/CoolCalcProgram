# CoolCalcProgram
I was in a snarky mood, so I made CoolCalc, the miserable arithmetic calculator that insults you at every usage.
calc.c is the source code, and the CoolCalc file is a Linux executable made with gcc on a Raspberry Pi 4.
I've never distributed my programs before, so I don't know if the CoolCalc executable will work on all machines,
if not, the source code is here for you to mess around with.

To compile the source code, just type:
gcc -Wall calc.c -o CoolCalc

You can also compile it however you do with clang, but I don't use clang so you're on your own.

I did my best to make CoolCalc look like a legit terminal program made by professionals at first (namely though the ASCII art logo and the fake company name)
while it descends into madness after that. It IS in fact functional though.
