# CoolCalcProgram
I was in a snarky mood, so I made CoolCalc, the miserable arithmetic calculator that insults you at every usage.
I've never distributed my programs before, so I guarantee it completely sucks compared to anything else on GitHub.

To compile the source code, just type:
gcc -Wall calc.c -o CoolCalc

[Update: added a Makefile to save you 5 seconds of time.]
[Update: as of Jan. 06, 2024, there is now a .deb package to save you 5 more seconds of time, with more package types to come]

You can also compile it however you do with clang, but I don't use clang so you're on your own.

I did my best to make CoolCalc look like a legit terminal program made by professionals at first (namely though the ASCII art logo and the fake company name)
while it descends into madness after that. It IS in fact functional though.

If you have any suggestions on how I can make the program even crappier, feel free to let me know.
